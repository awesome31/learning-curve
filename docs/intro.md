# Commit & Learn

## Who Am I?

Hi all. My name is Rohit Tyagi and I work as an **SDE3 at Mosaic Wellness**. I have been working as a software engineer for the past 6 years, primarily working on the frontend tech stack (web and mobile applications) with focus on creating robust and scalable system. Currently my responsibilties include:

1. Creating new set of features for the apps that we have created.
2. Architecting the frontend systems to cater to any product needs.
3. Managing end to end release cycle of the apps that we have created.
4. Managing the product part of the Frontend team. Currently I have 5 reportees under me.

## What is this?

Software engineering is a dynamic and ever-evolving field. As engineers, we must continuously adapt, learn, and stay updated with the latest technologies to remain effective in our craft. This repository serves as my personal journal—a curated log of everything I’ve learned and the projects I’ve built along the way. It’s a reflection of my growth, curiosity, and commitment to lifelong learning in this exciting field.
