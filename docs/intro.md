## Who Am I?

Hi! I'm **Rohit Tyagi**, a software engineer with 6+ years of experience building products that scale. My journey started in frontend engineering, crafting robust web and mobile applications, architecting scalable systems, and leading teams at **Mosaic Wellness** as an SDE3.

But here's where it gets interesting: I've pivoted into the world of **AI**.

Today, I'm building at **[Zonko](https://www.zonko.ai/)**, a frontier AI lab working on cutting-edge problems. My focus has shifted from pixels and components to **deep learning** and **agentic AI systems**. I'm fascinated by how we can build intelligent systems that don't just respond, but reason, plan, and act autonomously.

The transition from frontend to AI wasn't a leap, it was a natural evolution. The same principles that made me effective at building user-facing systems, attention to detail, system thinking, and user-centric design, now apply to building AI systems that millions will interact with daily.

## What Is This?

This repository is my learning journal, a curated log of everything I'm discovering in AI, deep learning, and agentic systems. It's also a reflection of my frontend roots, documenting the patterns, architectures, and insights that shaped my engineering journey.

Software engineering is dynamic. AI is moving even faster. This is where I capture that evolution: experiments, breakthroughs, failures, and the compounding knowledge that can't be copied.

## Where I've Built

### Current: [Zonko](https://www.zonko.ai/)

Building AI-native products that could reach billions. We're shipping fast, watching what spreads, and compounding taste until something breaks through.
