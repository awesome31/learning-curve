# AWS Solutions Architect

I have been learning about AWS and preparing for solutions architect. I am learning AWS and skills not to pass the exam but to practically implement it in real life. Starting Adrian Cantrill's Course has been the best decision for the aim that I have. All screenshots and resources are from the course. [Do check the courses out.](https://learn.cantrill.io)

**All the things that I am learning and the notes are in the sidebar.**
