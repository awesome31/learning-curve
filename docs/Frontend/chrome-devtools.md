### Web Performance Metrics

There are 3 core web vitals that google tracks:

1. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): The time it takes for the largest visible element to be painted on the screen.
2. First Input Delay (FID): The time it takes for the browser to respond to the first user interaction.
3. Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): The sum of all layout shifts that occur during the page load.

The other way to think of performance is RAIL: Response, Animation, Idle, Load.
