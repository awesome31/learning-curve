# Introduction to React

This page contains all the things that we will be learning about React. We will talk about react 18 and 19. We will be creating sections for each topic which has the codebase and notes for the topic.

## Basics

1. We have 2 packages, react and react-dom. react is the universal package that can be used in any environment. react-dom is the package that is used for the browser environment.
2. createElement has 3 main parameters: element name, properties and children.

```js
React.createElement("h1", null, "Kake da Pizza");
```

3. The building block of React is components. A component is an encapsulated piece of UI that given the properties, returns the UI.
