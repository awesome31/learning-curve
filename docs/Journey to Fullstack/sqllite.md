# SQLite

SQLite is by far the most used database in the world. It requires so little setup that it can used literally in any system that requires a database.

Unlike other databases, SQLite is a file-based database. This means that it stores all of its data in a single file on the file system instead of a server and sharing data over a network. Yes we can use SQLite in production, but this database is INTENTIONALLY a small.
