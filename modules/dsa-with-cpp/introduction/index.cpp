/**
 * Introduction to Data Structures:
 * 1. Data Structure is an arragement of data so that they can be utilised efficiently.
 * 2. Each Computing System will have a processor, which is responsible for executing a set of instructions, memory which is ephemeral and hard drive, which is permanent memory.
 * 3. A program and the data, both have to brought inside the main memory. Every applications deals with some data. Data structures are used inside a running program.
 * 4. Databases are a way to store data at rest.

 /**
  * Stack vs Heap Memory:
  * 1. Every Byte has its address. The main memory, is divided into manageable chunks of memory, called segments.
  * 2. Each segment is divided into multiple sections:
  *     - Code Section: This section is where the program resides.
  *     - Stack: This is where the local memory of the program lives. This is called the stack frame of the main function.
  *     - Heap: Heap means randomly allocated memory. It should be treated like a resource. Heap memory can only be accessed using pointers. Pointers take 8 bytes.
  * 3. Static Memory Allocation means that at compile time, the size of the memory is defined.
  * 4. Dynamic Memory Allocation means that at compile time, the size of the memory is NOT defined.

/**
 * Phyiscal and Logical Data Structures:
 * 1. Physical Data Structures are data structures that decide how the memory is organised.
 *  - Array:  It is directly supported in any programming language. It is contigous memory location.
 *  - Linked List: Always created in Heap. These are created if the size of the list if not defined.
 * 2. Logical Data Structures are data structures are built on top of the physical DS.
 *  - Tree
 *  - Graphs
 *  - Stacks
 *  - Queues
 *  - Hash Tables

/**
 * Abstract Data Type (ADT)
 * A datatype is defined by: Representation of Data and Operations on Data. Primitive Data Types are things that we know about the representation and operation. Abstract Data Types are data types that are user defined.
