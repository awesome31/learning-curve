/**
    AVL Trees are BSTs which are height balanced. That means the balance factor
   (height of lsubtree - rsubtree) of each node in an AVL tree is  <= 1. With
   AVL trees, we make sure our searching etc becomes very fast.

   1. For inserting in AVL tree, we have to perform rotations. There are 4 types
   of rotations that we can do:
    - LL Rotation
    - LR Rotation
    - RL Rotation
    - RR Rotation
