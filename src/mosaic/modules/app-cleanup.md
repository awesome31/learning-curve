# App Cleanup

Things that we have to remove:

- [ ] Trends
- [ ] Native SO screens
- [ ] RX Cart Screen
- [ ] Localization Module as a whole
- [ ] App logo can be moved to the app config instead of having a new store.

Screens that we can remove (Probably):

- [ ] AuthCheck
- [ ] ForceUpdate
- [ ] RX_CART
- [ ] RX_CART Interstitial
- [ ] All Old Consult Screens
