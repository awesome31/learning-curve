    "### Neural Net Approach for Bigram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Till now we have been using a lookup table to store the probability of each bigram. Instead of that we can create a neural network to learn the probability of each bigram. Let us see how we can do it. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. First we will create our training set, which is the first character of each biagram and y is the second character of each biagram.\n",
    "2. Instead of using the stoi integer as the xs and ys, its better to one hot encode the xs and ys because neural networks usually expect continuous inputs/outputs or one hot encoded inputs/outputs.\n",
    "3. Next we will neurons. In NN, a neuron takes a set of weights and examples and outputs a single number.  We will havve 27 neurons.\n",
    "4. Now that we have 27 neurons, we want each neuron's otuput for each example to be probability of the second character of the bigram given the first character of the bigram. To do this we will use softmax activation function. logits are esentially log-counts.\n",
    "5. Now we can calculate the loss of the inputs. Since all the operations we have done for a neuron are differentiable, we can calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights of the neurons. We can then use gradient descent to update the weights of the neurons. "

    "What the above output tells you is that for each input, we are getting a log likelihood of how likely the model thinks the next character is. Now we want to optimise the weights of the neurons to make the log likelihood as high as possible. We can do this by using gradient descent. "
